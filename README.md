# GPR-350-Custom-Unity-Physics
Game Physics Engine Development in C# with Unity

Goal of the project is to create our own physics engine in Unity and to make a game using none of Unity's built in physics scripts. Most collisions come with proper gizmos to view the collision bounds!

Code is provided for both in-engine custom code to help people understand the different math equations required for physics. Also includes a DLL and packing system so we could maintain the C++ performance ( this does not have most of the advanced physics work that the C# has)


Commit dc6d8db24935d4da0f9140e1e04d55c36ec7f933
* Lab 5 Final Commit - Collision Response Circle v Circle, Circle v AABB, AABB v AABB, OBB v Circle, OBB v AABB, OBB v OBB
Note: not applying force to contact point just calculates the penetration and the contact norm
